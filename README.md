# MultiLauncher
RimWorld mod for a multi-function grenade launcher, firing over walls.
Requires Vanilla Expanded Framework.
Extra launchers if "Eccentric Extras - Flares" and/or "Eccentric Tech - Foxy's Armory" are loaded.
FAQ:
 - 1.5?
I don't know if it works in 1.5.
I probably won't be using 1.5 for a long time.
 - Yayo's Combat ammo?
Weapon tags for ammo are included and have been tested with Yayo's Combat 3 (Continued).
Industrial fire ammo for the launcher and flaregun, spacer fire ammo for the charged launcher.
   Fair warning, enabling Yayo's ammunition usage adds even more buttons to these guns.
 - CE?
Not much point to it.
Use "Combat Extended Guns", "Ammo Variety - Grenade Launchers", and "Launchers Tweak".
I think knockout gas grenades are still missing? But mine are slapdash anyway.
