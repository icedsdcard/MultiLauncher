# MultiLauncher
RimWorld mod for a multi-function grenade launcher that fires over walls.

Requires Vanilla Expanded Framework.

FAQ:

 - Compatibility?

Foxy's Armory: A spacer version of the multi-launcher is included. More damage, bigger explosion radius, smaller miss radius.

Eccentric Tech - Flares: A flare launcher is included, fires all the flare types.

Mortar Accuracy: Seems to have a conflict, causing the screen to shake and no projectiles to fire. I haven't tested in a minimal setup, so this could be a multi-mod-problem. Over-Wall Grenades faces the same issue.

 - Balanced?

No. Each fire mode is as good as or a bit better than a vanilla equivalent, and you get all of them in one, plus more, over walls.

But it's not on the level of "Glitter Tech", "Science Never Stops", or "Kraltech Industries".

 - Yayo's Combat ammo?

Weapon tags for ammo are included and have been tested with "Yayo's Combat 3 (Continued)".

Industrial fire ammo for the launcher and flaregun, spacer fire ammo for the charged launcher.

Fair warning, enabling Yayo's ammunition usage adds even more buttons to these guns.

 - CE?

Not much point to it.

Use "Combat Extended Guns", "Ammo Variety - Grenade Launchers", and "Launchers Tweak".

I think knockout gas grenades are missing? But mine are slapdash anyway.

- Steam Workshop?

I don't plan to put it up.
You can upload it, as long as you include a link back to the Github page.

- Which mode to use?

Slug is just a solid bullet, to limit collateral damage. Standard bullet accuracy, no over-wall shots.

HEAT only damages one tile, and is not a guaranteed hit. Lots of damage and armor penetration.

Frag has weak armor penetration, but a wide damage radius.

Thump has high building damage. Less pawn damage than Frag, and smaller radius, but higher armor penetration.

Anesthetic applies the anesthetic hediff while doing minimal damage. Same armor penetration as a slug shot, but hediff buildup is reduced by toxic environment resistance.

Stun just stuns for a couple seconds, similar to EMP but on everyone.

Incendiary, EMP, Smoke, Firefoam, and Toxbomb are similar to the vanilla launchers/mortar shells.
