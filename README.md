# MultiLauncher
RimWorld mod for a multi-function grenade launcher that fires over walls.
Requires Vanilla Expanded Framework.
Extra launchers if "Eccentric Extras - Flares" and/or "Eccentric Tech - Foxy's Armory" are loaded.
FAQ:
 - Balanced?

No. Each fire mode is as good as or a bit better than a vanilla equivalent, and you get all of them in one, plus more, over walls.

But it's not "Glitter Tech", "Science Never Stops", or "Kraltech Industries".

 - Yayo's Combat ammo?

Weapon tags for ammo are included and have been tested with "Yayo's Combat 3 (Continued)".

Industrial fire ammo for the launcher and flaregun, spacer fire ammo for the charged launcher.

Fair warning, enabling Yayo's ammunition usage adds even more buttons to these guns.
 - CE?

Not much point to it.

Use "Combat Extended Guns", "Ammo Variety - Grenade Launchers", and "Launchers Tweak".

I think knockout gas grenades are still missing? But mine are slapdash anyway.
 - Steam Workshop?

I don't plan to put it up.
You can upload it, as long as you include a link back to the Github page.

 - Damage types?
Explosive does high damage over a wide area, but has little armor penetration, and reduced damage against buildings. (Fragmentation would describe it better, but changing the label might affect backwards compatibility.)
HEAT damages only the tile it hits, but has very high armor penetration.
Thump damage is very strong against buildings and walls.
Anesthetic does very small damage, and adds some anesthetic. Should be affected by toxic environment resistance.
Stun, stuns.
Incendiary, EMP, Tox, Firefoam, and Smoke are like the vanilla equivalent, stats are the same or better.
The charged launcher (Foxy's Armory) has higher damage, higher explosion radius, and lower miss radius.
